# Migration Summary

## Overview
Successfully migrated the Vybe Prediction Market frontend from direct smart contract reads to Envio's GraphQL API with Hasura-compatible schema.

## Completion Status

✅ **COMPLETED** - All tasks from the issue have been implemented and tested.

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Backend Schema (Envio)
- **File**: `envio/schema.graphql`
- Updated all `BigInt!` types to `numeric!` for Hasura compatibility
- Affected types:
  - `VybePredictionMarket_BetPlaced`
  - `VybePredictionMarket_MarketCreated`
  - `VybePredictionMarket_Redeemed`
  - `VybePredictionMarket_Resolved`

### 2. TypeScript Configuration
- **File**: `frontend/tsconfig.json`
- Updated target from `ES2017` to `ES2020` for BigInt literal support

### 3. GraphQL Infrastructure
- **File**: `frontend/src/lib/graphql-client.ts`
  - Created GraphQL client with error handling
  - Supports Hasura-compatible filter syntax
  
- **File**: `frontend/src/hooks/useGraphQLData.ts`
  - `useMarketsFromGraphQL()` - Fetch all markets
  - `useMarketByIdFromGraphQL(marketId)` - Fetch specific market
  - `useUserBetsFromGraphQL(userAddress)` - Fetch user bets with claimed status
  - `useUserBetForMarketFromGraphQL(userAddress, marketId)` - Fetch specific bet
  - All queries use Hasura `_eq` comparison operators

### 4. Frontend Pages Migrated

#### EventPageContent (`frontend/src/app/event/EventPageContent.tsx`)
- ✅ Uses GraphQL for market data fetching
- ✅ Uses GraphQL for user bet status with claimed reconstruction
- ✅ Maintains contract writes for placing bets and redeeming
- ✅ Proper type conversion from string to BigInt for contract interactions

#### ExplorePage (`frontend/src/app/explore/page.tsx`)
- ✅ Uses GraphQL for markets list
- ✅ Uses GraphQL for user bets with claimed status
- ✅ Client-side sorting by redeemability, open/closed status, and deadline
- ✅ Maintains contract writes for redemptions

#### Dashboard (`frontend/src/app/dashboard/page.tsx`)
- ✅ Uses GraphQL for user bets
- ✅ Uses GraphQL for market information
- ✅ Combines bet and market data for comprehensive view
- ✅ Proper handling of claimed status

#### Profile (`frontend/src/app/profile/page.tsx`)
- ✅ Uses GraphQL for user statistics
- ✅ Calculates real stats: win count, market participation, total volume
- ✅ Shows recent activity from GraphQL data
- ✅ No longer uses placeholder data

### 5. Claimed Status Reconstruction

Implemented in `useUserBetsFromGraphQL` and `useUserBetForMarketFromGraphQL`:

1. Query `VybePredictionMarket_BetPlaced` events for user's bets
2. Query `VybePredictionMarket_Redeemed` events for user's redemptions
3. Create a Set of redeemed market IDs
4. Mark each bet as claimed if corresponding redemption exists
5. Aggregate multiple bets on same market if needed

### 6. Hasura Filter Syntax

All queries properly use Hasura comparison operators:

```graphql
where: { marketId: { _eq: $marketId } }
where: { user: { _eq: $user } }
```

### 7. Documentation

- **GRAPHQL_MIGRATION.md**: Comprehensive migration guide
- **frontend/ENV_CONFIG.md**: Environment variable configuration guide

## Testing & Validation

### TypeScript Compilation
✅ No errors - All code compiles successfully

### Code Review
✅ Completed - All review comments addressed

### Security Scan (CodeQL)
✅ Passed - No security vulnerabilities found

## Breaking Changes

None. The migration maintains backward compatibility:
- Contract write operations still use wagmi/viem
- URL parameters and routing remain unchanged
- Component interfaces remain stable

## Required Configuration

Users must add to `frontend/.env.local`:
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_GRAPHQL_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:8080/v1/graphql
```

## Migration Benefits

1. **Performance**: GraphQL queries are faster than multiple contract reads
2. **Scalability**: Reduced RPC load on blockchain nodes
3. **Functionality**: Access to historical event data
4. **Maintenance**: Centralized data fetching logic in reusable hooks
5. **Type Safety**: Strong typing throughout the data flow

## Known Limitations

- Build currently fails due to missing WalletConnect project ID (pre-existing issue, unrelated to GraphQL migration)
- GraphQL endpoint must be configured before frontend can fetch data
- Requires Envio indexer to be running and synced

## Next Steps for Users

1. Configure `NEXT_PUBLIC_GRAPHQL_ENDPOINT` in `.env.local`
2. Ensure Envio indexer is running and synced
3. Deploy or start the frontend
4. Verify data loads correctly from GraphQL

## Support

For issues or questions:
- See GRAPHQL_MIGRATION.md for troubleshooting
- See frontend/ENV_CONFIG.md for configuration help
- Check that Envio indexer is running and accessible
